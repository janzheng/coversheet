# Coversheet

Hey hey! 

Coversheet doesn't have a Github... because it's a bunch of Google Sheets formulas ðŸ™ˆ with some backend / server glue from  Val.town.

I'll figure out how to extract all of it and package it into a github for y'all to recreate it for yourselves!

Coversheet is free (until the credits run out) at https://coversheet.org â€” build some cool templates!
